A Progressive Web App that helps you find the perfect gift for your loved ones through a guided questionnaire.

> 📋 **Spec-Driven Development:** This project follows comprehensive specifications. See [docs/](./docs/) for detailed requirements, user stories, API reference, and test plans.

## Features

- **Smart Recommendations**: Get personalized gift suggestions based on a scoring algorithm
- **Progressive Web App**: Install on any device and works offline
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful UI that works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager

```bash
cd gift-finder
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash

```

The production-ready files will be in the `dist` folder.

### Preview Production Build

```bash

## How It Works

1. **Welcome Screen**: Users are greeted with an introduction to the app
2. **Questionnaire**: Users answer 6 questions about the gift recipient:
   - Relationship to the person
   - Age group
   - Gender
   - Occasion
   - Interests (multiple selection)
   - Budget range
3. **Results**: The app displays up to 10 personalized gift recommendations with match scores
4. **Restart**: Users can start a new search for a different person

## Recommendation Algorithm

Gifts are scored based on multiple factors:
- **Age Match** (weight: 3 points)
- **Budget Match** (weight: 4 points)
- **Occasion Match** (weight: 3 points)
- **Interest Matches** (weight: 2 points per matching interest)

Gifts are then sorted by score and the top 10 are displayed.
